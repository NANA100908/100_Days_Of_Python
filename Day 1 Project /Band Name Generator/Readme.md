# Band Name Generator

Welcome to the **Band Name Generator** project! This is a simple Python program designed to help users come up with creative and fun band names by combining user-provided inputs.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu. It is the Day 1 project and serves as an introduction to basic Python concepts such as:

- Printing output to the console.
- Taking user input.
- String manipulation.
- Combining strings.

## How It Works
The Band Name Generator asks the user for two pieces of information:
1. The name of the city where they grew up.
2. The name of their favorite pet.

It then combines these inputs to create a unique band name.

### Example
If the user inputs:
- City: **Paris**
- Pet: **Fluffy**

The program will generate the band name: **Paris Fluffy**.

## Features
- Interactive user input.
- Simple and beginner-friendly.
- Generates creative and personalized band names.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository or download the `Band Name Generator ` folder.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. Run the program using the command:
   ```
   task.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate your band name.

## Learnings
Through this project, I learned:
- How to use the `print()` function to display messages.
- How to use the `input()` function to collect user input.
- Basic string concatenation in Python.

## Future Enhancements
- Add random adjectives to the band name for more creativity.
- Allow users to input multiple cities or pet names and generate multiple options.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
